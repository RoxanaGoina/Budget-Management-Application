# Budget-Management-Application

The project is an application that allows the user to manage his budget.
This is done as follows: the user will create objects. The user will later create purchase lists, and the elements of these lists are the previously created objects.
The user can view and/or complete a list of purchases, this involves assigning a price and a calendar date to a list.
At the same time, the application allows the user to export the lists in CSV and PDF format. 
The user can also view the total amount spent in the current month in the form of a graph. 
The total amount can also be viewed in different monetary units (euro, pound sterling, etc.), these values are extracted from a REST API (Exchange Rates API).
 On the other hand, the application also allows the comparison regarding the total amounts from the last 3 months 
 (a comparison is made in the form of bar charts regarding the current month, the previous month and the month before the previous one).
 
 The project was made using Java as programming language. 
 For graphical interface was used JavaFx. For improving graphical interface were used elements of HTML and CSS. 
 Data storage within the project was done with the help of databases. It was used as the H2 database.
